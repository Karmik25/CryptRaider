# Crypt Raider - Game ReadMe

## 🕹️ About the Game
Crypt Raider is an intense, atmospheric puzzle-adventure game set inside an ancient underground crypt. The objective is simple but thrilling: retrieve the valuable **statue** from the crypt and escape without getting locked inside!

Once the player picks up the statue, **the main gate automatically locks down**. Players must act quickly and use their environment wisely to avoid being trapped forever.

You can pick up certain objects by **holding the 'F' key**, and **release the 'F' key** to drop them. Strategically placing objects can help trigger mechanisms or prevent doors from closing.

- Dynamic **gate closing mechanism** triggered when picking up the statue
